# older_presentation_repo
This is the repo where i started to code my presentation, 
but i did some bad tricks that results in a repo with too files
that currently i'm not using.

This repository have weight problems, by this reason i created "presentation"
and there i'm currently working.

Well... not everything is bad, at least i have this experience about repositories.
